        <h6>1986-2004/2015-2019</h6>
        
        <p >I was born in this city and I am in love with this city. At first, I thought I loved it because my family and relatives were there, but over time, the city itself started to feel like one of my closest friends. Where to eat, what to eat, where to have a picnic, where ice cream is good, knowing these makes you feel at home. Although it may seem like a small city at first, it is my hometown that has managed to get used to one's blood over time.</p>
        <h2 id="ankara">Ankara</h2>
        <h6>2004-2015</h6>
        <p >I went to Ankara for university education. I found my wife there. my daughter was born. All my good years were spent there. It is a city that I want to go to every day while I live, which I can never get used to, but which I appreciate when I leave. I still cannot forget the taste of the desserts I ate at super patisseries and restaurants. .I made very good friends and actually I have a home here for the first time. one of those who are missed when you go...</p>
        <h2 id="nea smyrni"> Nea Smyrni</h2>
        <h6>2019-2020</h6>
        <p >The city I reached with great difficulty after a great turmoil. very precious to me. A city that embraces me and heals my wounds. Unfortunately, they also gave 5 extra kilos as a gift due to their very delicious bread. One of the most beautiful districts of Athens. It's not actually a city. It's the city that brought me together with my old friends. the weather is super and the parks are also super. I won't talk more about bread. Even thinking about it, I seem to have gained 1 kg. and its name is greek for izmir, one of the most beautiful cities in turkey. even the names of the streets are the names of the district of Izmir. I think Izmir is a city founded by lovers. There are a lot of people of Greek origin who immigrated from Turkey. This city taught me the pain of people who had to leave the country that I was not even aware of.</p>
        <h2 id="zutphen">Zuthpen</h2>
        <h6>2019-2020</h6>
        <p >The first city I lived in the Netherlands. I thought I was living in a very small city. However, it was a big city compared to the Netherlands. I always traveled by bike. How many times have I shopped here? Even though the camp life was difficult, it became more beautiful with nice people. A true wonder of nature, green in all seasons. It hooked me with its beautiful walking areas and beautiful shopping streets. I always felt like I was on vacation there. and I loved it here too.</p>
        <h2 id="groot-ammers">Groot-Ammers</h2>
        <h6>2021-?</h6>
        
        <p >And now we have finally come to our new hometown. I say my hometown because it became a city that I immediately adopted in a year. If you remember that I couldn't get used to Ankara for 10 years, it is understood that it was very fast. The feeling of finally belonging somewhere was very important. moreover, for the first time in almost 5-6 years, it became my smart home. The streets are beautiful, the houses are beautiful, especially the street where I live. My neighbors have arranged their garden very well. As you pass in front of people, it opens up. Although it is far from big cities, I warmed up immediately. After a lot of hardship, this calmness was good for my soul.</p>
